# Customer Churn Rate Analysis
This interactive Power BI dashboard delivers a comprehensive and actionable analysis of customer churn for TechX Telecommunications, empowering the company to proactively address and mitigate factors driving customer attrition. By integrating a rich dataset encompassing customer demographics, service utilization, and billing details, this dashboard transforms complex data into clear, compelling visualizations.

The dashboard's core functionality centers on identifying key drivers of churn. Interactive charts and filters enable a granular exploration of churn rates across diverse customer segments, including gender, senior citizen status, partner/dependent presence, and tenure. This allows TechX to pinpoint specific demographics exhibiting higher churn tendencies.

Service usage patterns are meticulously analyzed, highlighting correlations between service adoption (PhoneService, InternetService, MultipleLines, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, TechSupport) and customer churn. Visualizations reveal potential areas for service improvement or targeted promotions.

Furthermore, the dashboard provides a detailed financial impact assessment, analyzing MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges to quantify the revenue loss associated with customer attrition. This enables ComX to prioritize retention efforts for high-value customers at risk. The relationship between payment methods, contract types, and churn is also explored, informing strategic retention initiatives.
